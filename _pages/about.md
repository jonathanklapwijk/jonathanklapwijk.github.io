I am a qualified research psychologist and D.Phil (PhD) candidate at the Department of Social Policy and Intervention at the University of Oxford, passionate about ensuring healthy development of every child, everywhere. My current work focuses on parenting interventions, caregiver-adolescent relationships, reducing violence and sexual violence against children, and using playful strategies for intervention in low-resource settings. I aim to generate meaningful change by bridging evidence-based academic rigour with real-world impact.

**About / Biography**
======
I am currently pursuing a Doctor of Philosophy in Social Intervention and Policy Evaluation at the University of Oxford, where my focus lies on designing, implementing, and evaluating a digital parenting intervention for families with adolescents in low- and middle-income contexts. My passion for research psychology emerged during my undergraduate and honors studies at the University of Pretoria, where I graduated with a BA in Psychology (Cum Laude) and a BSocSci Honours in Psychology. I further honed my research expertise by completing a MA in Psychology at the University of South Africa.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to numerous projects aimed at improving individual, family, and community development. Recently, I’ve worked extensively on the Parenting for Lifelong Health (PLH) human-digital parenting programmes under the umbrella of the Accelerating Achievement for Africa’s Adolescents (Accelerate) Hub and Global Parenting Initiative. As a LEGO Foundation Learning through Play Ambassador, I also advocate for playful leanring techniques as a pivotal part of children’s education and development.

Above all, my mission is to use evidence-based interventions to make a tangible difference in children’s lives. By collaborating with stakeholders across academic, nonprofit, and governmental sectors, I strive to foster environments where every child can flourish—intellectually, emotionally, and socially.
